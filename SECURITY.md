Reporting Security Issues
The Electron team and community place the utmost importance on addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and effectively. We value your dedication to responsibly disclose any security findings you may encounter, and we are committed to acknowledging and addressing your contributions swiftly and transparently.

How to Report a Security Issue
To report a security issue, please follow these steps:

Subject Line: Please include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line to ensure expedited attention to your report.

Disclosure Responsibility: We appreciate responsible disclosure. By reporting security issues to us first, you allow us the opportunity to investigate and implement fixes before public disclosure.

What to Expect
